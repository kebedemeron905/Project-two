##Project Idea:

For my second project I'm creating a virtual book shelf that will allow people to keep track of the books they've read.  It also allows other people  to comment their thoughts/favourite quotes below a specific book as well.

With that said, I'm going to have two models: book and comment.  

```js BookSchema 
  title: String,
  author: String,
  genera: String,
  reflection: String,
  publication: String,
  url: Srting

CommentSchema 
  comment: String,
  name: String
  ```
